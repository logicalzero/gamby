/*
GAMBY BlockMode Template
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A jump start on using Gamby to draw a 24x16 grid of 4x4 pixel 'blocks.' This 
skeletal sketch contains the bare minimum required to get Gamby running in 
BlockMode. Do a "Save As" to make a copy and fill it out with your own code!

// A sample palette of blocks, stored in program memory. You can replace one 
// or all of the individual blocks, but a palette can have no more than 16 
// blocks in it. Typically, you will have only one per sketch, but it is
// possible to create more than one and switch between them.
PROGMEM const uint16_t palette[] = {
    0x0000, //  0 All 'white' (block 0 should almost always be 0x0000) 
    0xffff, //  1 All 'black'
    0x5a5a, //  2 50% gray dither
    0xfaf5, //  3 75% gray dither
    0x050a, //  4 25% gray dither
    0xedb7, //  5 Light diagonal left line

// Each of Gamby's 'modes' are wrapped in a class, a self-contained unit

// you must first create an 'instance' of its class -- a sort of working 
// copy. Your sketch should only use one.

  // 'indoor' and an 'outdoor' palette.
